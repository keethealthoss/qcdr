The risk adjustment will be calculated using a logistic regression model using: baseline DASH score, baseline pain score, age, sex, payer, and symptom duration (time from surgery or injury to baseline physical therapy visit). \n\nThese measures will serve as a physical or occupational therapy performance measure at the eligible physical or occupational therapist or physical or occupational therapy group level.",
